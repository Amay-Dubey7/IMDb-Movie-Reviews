Here, I have tried my hands on popular IMDb dataset.

1.To start with the given dataset, it is necessary to encode the sentiment labels.
2.Performed Data cleaning on the dataset.
3.Tokenized the dataset using RegexpTokenizer.
4.Perform stemming followed by applying Bag of words model.
5.Using different approaches like naive-bayes,logistic regression, Random Forest, SVM,LSTM approach etc on the dataset to get the best possible result.
6.Random forest gave accuracy score of 88.3% and a respectable f1 score.


I tried my hands with different approach by using BERT Tokenizer as well and the results were astonishing.
I got score around 94.5% on the model.
